# Challenge Three
Create an Agent that uses the National Weather Service API and Google Maps Geocoding API as tools in order to answer weather related queries.

Enhance the agent using callbacks to log user prompts, model responses, and validate user input to ensure non-us locations are not sent.

See `agent_tools.py` for tool and moderation functions.
