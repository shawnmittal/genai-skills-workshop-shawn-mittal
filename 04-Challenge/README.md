# Challenge Four
1. Copy of one of your previous Jupyter notebooks to use as a starting point.
2. Add Greeter, Search, Critique, and Refine agents.
3. Use either a Sequential or Loop agent to build the answer team.
    * The Search agent finds the data to answer the question
    * The critique agent looks at the initial response and makes suggestions as to how it
can be improved
    * The Refine agent rewrites the response based on the improvements suggested
4. Write code to test your agents. Output events to your notebook that demonstrate the use
of the sub agents.
5. Upload your notebook to your GitHub repository for grading.
